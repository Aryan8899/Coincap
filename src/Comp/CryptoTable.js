              possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the
              chart to your own needs. These charts and their information are

            <br />
            <p className="text-gray-500">
              The very first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. Since it is open
              source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the
              code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate
              currency. Many people have done exactly this. Some of these coins
              are very similar to Bitcoin, with just one or two amended features
              (such as Litecoin), while others are very different, with varying
              models of security, issuance and governance. However, they all
              share the same moniker ‚Äî every coin issued after Bitcoin is
              considered to be an altcoin.

            <br />
            <p className="text-gray-500">
              The first chain to launch smart contracts was Ethereum. A smart
              contract enables multiple scripts to engage with each other using
              clearly defined rules, to execute on tasks which can become a
              coded form of a contract. They have revolutionized the digital
              asset space because they have enabled decentralized exchanges,
              decentralized finance, ICOs, IDOs and much more. A huge proportion
              of the value created and stored in cryptocurrency is enabled by
              smart contracts.

            <br />
            <p className="text-gray-500">
              Price volatility has long been one of the features of the
              cryptocurrency market. When asset prices move quickly in either
              direction and the market itself is relatively thin, it can
              sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed.
              To overcome this problem, a new type of cryptocurrency tied in
              value to existing currencies ‚Äî ranging from the U.S. dollar, other
              fiats or even other cryptocurrencies ‚Äî arose. These new
              cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins, and they can be used for
              a multitude of purposes due to their stability.

              available to retail investors in the United States. This opens the
